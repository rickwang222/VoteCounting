The program is run by typing "javac DualSystemBallotCounter.java" followed by java DualSystemBallotCounter arg is the path to the csv file and all csv files that we used are stored in the testing folder. A few tests such as partyTest and readCSVTest need to be compiled and run on their own since they do not use junit to test as it involved comparing print statements manually. We could not get assertEquals to work properlly for this type of test so we made it be a test that needs to be manually run and compared.
